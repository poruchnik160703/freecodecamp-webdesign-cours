# HTML Learning Projects

This repository contains my beginner HTML projects created as part of my learning journey with freeCodeCamp.

## About
These projects were built to practice core HTML concepts such as:
- page structure
- semantic elements
- images, audio, and video
- links and basic accessibility

All projects are written in pure HTML, without CSS or JavaScript.

## Projects

### 1. Recipe Page
A simple HTML page describing a traditional Russian borscht recipe.
- Headings and lists
- Image with alt text
- Ordered and unordered lists

### 2. Travel Agency Page
A basic travel agency landing page.
- Links with target="_blank"
- Images with captions
- Semantic structure

### 3. Audio and Video Player
An HTML page demonstrating media elements.
- <video> with controls
- <audio> with loop
- Semantic sections and footer

## Notes
These projects are educational and reflect my current learning stage.
More advanced versions with CSS and JavaScript will be added later.
