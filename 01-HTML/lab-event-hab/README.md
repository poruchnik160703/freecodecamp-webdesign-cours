# Event Hub

This project is a beginner-level HTML page created to practice building
a well-structured web page using semantic HTML elements.

The page represents an event hub with upcoming and past events,
including navigation links and images.

## What I practiced
- Using semantic HTML elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Creating internal navigation with anchor links
- Structuring content using headings hierarchy (`h1`–`h3`)
- Adding images with descriptive `alt` text
- Organizing content for accessibility and readability

## Technologies
- HTML5 only

## About this project
This is an educational project created as part of my HTML learning journey
with freeCodeCamp. The focus of this project is clean structure,
semantic markup, and accessibility.
