# Student Feedback Survey Form

This project is a beginner-level HTML form created to practice working with
form elements and semantic HTML.

## What I practiced
- Building a complete HTML form
- Using different input types (`text`, `email`, `number`)
- Working with labels and explicit form associations
- Using radio buttons, checkboxes, select, and textarea elements
- Applying basic form validation with HTML attributes
- Structuring content with semantic HTML (`main`, `footer`)

## Technologies
- HTML5 only

## About this project
This is an educational project created as part of my HTML learning journey
with freeCodeCamp.
