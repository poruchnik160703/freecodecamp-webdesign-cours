# HTML Audio and Video Player

This project is a beginner-level HTML page created to practice working with
audio and video elements.

## What I practiced
- Using the video element with controls
- Using the audio element with loop
- Organizing content with semantic HTML (`main`, section, `footer`)
- Adding accessible fallback text

## Technologies
- HTML5 only

## About this project
This is an educational project created as part of my HTML learning journey with freeCodeCamp.
